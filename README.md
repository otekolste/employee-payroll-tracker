# Employee Payroll Tracker

## Description
This is a simple site that prompts the user to enter information about employees, and displays them in a chart. It can also calculate the average salary between all employees, and randomly pick an employee.
I programmed the functions that take the information from the user about the employees, calculate the average salary between the employees, and choose a random employee. I created this in order to practice my JavaScript skills, including the foundational conceps such as arrays, objects, fucntions, and both for and while loops. Doing so allowed me to get practice in the fundamentals of JS in a project that resembles real-world assignments.
